# Calorie-Counter
In the main menu of the program, only point 1 and point 5 work, as I copied some code from the internet and I figured I didn't need the rest of the points.
Point 1 is used to add another type of food to the "database" and point 5 is where all the calculations are made.
Thank you for taking the time to read this!

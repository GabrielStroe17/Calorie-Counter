# Calorie-Counter
This is a Calorie Counter that I have created in order to help one of my parents at their workplace. They were assigned to do some calorie calculations on paper that were taking too much time. Those were calculations for meals given to kids at some kindergarten. I decided to create a C++ program that can do that job hundreds of times faster.
In the main menu of the program, only point 1 and point 5 work, as I copied some code from the internet and I figured I didn't need the rest of the points.
Point 1 is used to add another type of food to the "database" and point 5 is where all the calculations are made.
Thank you for taking the time to read this!
